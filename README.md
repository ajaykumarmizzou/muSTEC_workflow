# setup.sh
#
# This script is used to set up the pipeline for running and accessing data from the data folder and reference genome from the genome folder.
#
# Usage:
#   ./setup.sh
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Ensure that the data folder contains the necessary data files.
#   - Ensure that the genome folder contains the reference genome files.
#
# Steps:
#   1. Check if the data folder and genome folder exist.
#   2. If the folders do not exist, create them.
#   3. Copy the data files to the data folder.
#   4. Copy the reference genome files to the genome folder.
#   5. Perform any additional setup steps required for the pipeline.
#
# Example:
#   ./setup.sh
#
# Note:
#   - Make sure to update the paths to the data and genome folders if they are different in your setup.
#   - This script assumes that the necessary data and genome files are already available.
#   - Additional setup steps may be required depending on the specific pipeline being used.
